# VRware
VRware is a virtual reality project based out of UNC Chapel Hill that aims to help entrepreneurs, consultants, lawyers, politicans, and other professionals with presentations. 

Our goal is to design a Virtual Reality app that allows you to immerse yourself in a realistic environment for presentations. You'll be able to record your presentation via the headset and view analytics for your speech and body movement on our web application: vrware.tech

# My Contributions
I'm one of the early members of VRware. I joined in March of 2020. Since then, I've been leaading VR development – designing the scenes for our presentations, UI for users, and body position tracking (pacing movement, hand movement, and eye tracking). My partner on VR is Jiayi Xu. She has been working on audio recording.

Scene Design: The images folder contains photos of scenes I have designed. 

Business Team: I also made significant contributions on the business side. I designed our current pricing model, obtained funding through grant proposals and applications, developed a pitch deck for investors, and interviewed users for feedback and iteration.
